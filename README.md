# code-blog
_Assignment for Code Fellows 301_

Code-blog is a single-page blog that imports its content from `js/hackerIpsum.json`. Users can filter blog posts by authors or categories.

A page (`stats.html`) has been added to calculate vanity metrics. It displays numbers including total author, article, and word count.

There is also a editor page (`secret.html`) for author to add content. The page takes styling in markdown format and displays a preview instantly. It can also convert the data to a JSON string for use in the raw data file.
