    body:        '<p>King delivered his prayer for our country. Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time. I have come here to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world; <img src="http://lorempixel.com/300/250/people/" class="pull-left">one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect; and one based upon the truth that America and Islam are not exclusive, and need not be in competition. They endure the daily humiliations - large and small - that come with occupation. The issues that I have described will not be easy to address.</p><p>They know those things. <img src="http://lorempixel.com/300/250/business/" class="pull-right">Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Those stories - of survival, and freedom, and hope - became our story, my story; the blood that had spilled was our blood, the tears our tears; until this black church, on this bright day, seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into future generations and into a larger world. But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes. When one nation pursues a nuclear weapon, the risk of nuclear attack rises for all nations.</p><p>But we also know our conscience cannot rest so long as the war goes on in Iraq.<img src="http://lorempixel.com/300/350/business/" class="pull-left"> It is not enough to give health care to the sick, or jobs to the jobless, or education to our children. So long as our relationship is defined by our differences, we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace, and who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and prosperity.</p><p>On November 4th, we must stand up and say: "Eight is enough." If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it\'s best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know. It was innovation in Muslim communities that developed the order of algebra; our magnetic compass and tools of navigation; our mastery of pens and printing; our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can be healed.</p><p>And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure. But race is an issue that I believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now. So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President. It was innovation in Muslim communities that developed the order of algebra; our magnetic compass and tools of navigation; our mastery of pens and printing; our understanding of how disease spreads and how it can be healed. But I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things: the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed; confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice; government that is transparent and doesn\'t steal from the people; the freedom to live as you choose. Now let me be clear: issues of women\'s equality are by no means simply an issue for Islam.</p><p>Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless the United States of America.</p>'
